# 242-assignment

This program can be used to process two groups of words. The first group of words will be read from stdin and will be inserted into the tree.
The second group of words will be read from a file specified on the command line. If any word read from the file is not contained in the tree then it should get printed to stdout. A moment of reflection will confirm that this program can be used to perform a basic spell check.

A combination tree ADT which can be either an ordinary binary search tree or a balanced red-black tree has been used to implement this program.
